# Exchange Server storage configuration options

Understanding the storage options and requirements for Mailbox servers in Exchange Server 2016 and Exchange Server 2019 is an important part of your Mailbox server storage design solution.

## Storage architectures

The following table describes supported storage architectures and provides best practice guidance for each type of storage architecture where appropriate.

**Supported storage architectures**

|**Storage architecture**|**Description**|**Best practice**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Direct-attached storage (DAS)|DAS is a digital storage system directly attached to a server or workstation, without a storage network in between. For example, DAS transports include Serial Attached Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) and Serial Attached Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA).|Not available.|
|Storage area network (SAN): Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI)|SAN is an architecture to attach remote computer storage devices (such as disk arrays and tape libraries) to servers in such a way that the devices appear as locally attached to the operating system (for example, block storage). iSCSI SANs encapsulate SCSI commands within IP packets and use standard networking infrastructure as the storage transport (for example, Ethernet).|Don't share physical disks backing up Exchange data with other applications. <br/> Use dedicated storage networks. <br/> Use multiple network paths for stand-alone configurations.|
|SAN: Fibre Channel|Fibre Channel SANs encapsulate SCSI commands within Fibre Channel packets and generally utilize specialized Fibre Channel networks as the storage transport.|Don't share physical disks backing up Exchange data with other applications. <br/> Use multiple Fibre Channel network paths for stand-alone configurations. <br/> Follow storage vendor's best practices for tuning Fibre Channel host bus adapters (HBAs), for example, Queue Depth and Queue Target.|

A network-attached storage (NAS) unit is a self-contained computer connected to a network, with the sole purpose of supplying file-based data storage services to other devices on the network. The operating system and other software on the NAS unit provide the functionality of data storage, file systems, and access to files, and the management of these functions (for example, file storage).

All storage used by Exchange for storage of Exchange data must be block-level storage because Exchange 2016 and Exchange 2019 do not support the use of NAS volumes, other than in the SMB 3.0 scenario outlined in the topic [Exchange Server virtualization](../../plan-and-deploy/virtualization.md). In a virtualized environment, NAS storage that's presented to the guest as block-level storage via the hypervisor isn't supported.

Using storage tiers is not recommended as it could adversely affect system performance. For this reason, do not allow the storage controller to automatically move the most accessed files to "faster" storage.

## Physical disk types
<a name="Phys"> </a>

The following table provides a list of supported physical disk types and provides best practice guidance for each physical disk type where appropriate.

**Supported physical disk types**

|**Physical disk type**|**Description**|**Supported or best practice**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Serial ATA (SATA)|SATA is a serial interface for ATA and integrated device electronics (IDE) disks. SATA disks are available in a variety of form factors, speeds, and capacities. <br/> In general, choose SATA disks for Exchange 2016 mailbox storage when you have the following design requirements: <br/>• High capacity <br/>• Moderate performance <br/>• Moderate power utilization|Supported: 512-byte sector disks for Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2. In addition, 512e disks are supported for Windows Server 2008 R2 with the following: <br/>• The hotfix described in [KB982018](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=3052&kbid=982018). <br/>• Windows Server 2008 R2 with Service Pack 1 (SP1) and Exchange Server 2010 SP1. <br/> Exchange 2013 and later supports native 4-kilobyte (KB) sector disks and 512e disks. Support requires that all copies of a database reside on the same physical disk type. For example, it is not a supported configuration to host one copy of a given database on a 512-byte sector disk and another copy of that same database on a 512e disk or 4K disk. <br/> Best practice: Consider enterprise class SATA disks, which generally have better heat, vibration, and reliability characteristics.|
|Serial Attached SCSI|Serial Attached SCSI is a serial interface for SCSI disks. Serial Attached SCSI disks are available in a variety of form factors, speeds, and capacities. <br/> In general, choose Serial Attached SCSI disks for Exchange 2016 mailbox storage when you have the following design requirements: <br/>• Moderate capacity <br/>• High performance <br/>• Moderate power utilization|Supported: 512-byte sector disks for Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2. In addition, 512e disks are supported for Windows Server 2008 R2 with the following: <br/>• The hotfix described in [KB982018](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=3052&kbid=982018). <br/>• Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 and Exchange Server 2010 SP1. <br/> Exchange 2013 and later supports native 4-kilobyte (KB) sector disks and 512e disks. Support requires that all copies of a database reside on the same physical disk type. For example, it is not a supported configuration to host one copy of a given database on a 512-byte sector disk and another copy of that same database on a 512e disk or 4K disk. <br/> Best practice: Physical disk-write caching must be disabled when used without a UPS.|
|Fibre Channel|Fibre Channel is an electrical interface used to connect disks to Fibre Channel-based SANs. Fibre Channel disks are available in a variety of speeds and capacities. <br/>  In general, choose Fibre Channel disks for Exchange 2016 mailbox storage when you have the following design requirements: <br/>• Moderate capacity <br/>• High performance <br/>• SAN connectivity|Supported: 512-byte sector disks for Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2. In addition, 512e disks are supported for Windows Server 2008 R2 with the following: <br/>• The hotfix described in [KB982018](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=3052&kbid=982018). <br/>• Windows Server 2008 R2 with Service Pack 1 (SP1) and Exchange Server 2010 SP1. <br/> Exchange 2013 and later supports native 4-kilobyte (KB) sector disks and 512e disks. Support requires that all copies of a database reside on the same physical disk type. For example, it is not a supported configuration to host one copy of a given database on a 512-byte sector disk and another copy of that same database on a 512e disk or 4K disk. <br/> Best practice: Physical disk-write caching must be disabled when used without a UPS.|
|Solid-state drive (SSD) (flash disk)|An SSD is a data storage device that uses solid-state memory to store persistent data. An SSD emulates a hard disk drive interface. SSD disks are available in a variety of speeds (different I/O performance capabilities) and capacities. <br/> In general, choose SSD disks for Exchange 2016 mailbox storage when you have the following design requirements: <br/>• Low capacity <br/>• Extremely high performance <br/> |Supported: 512-byte sector disks for Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2. In addition, 512e disks are supported for Windows Server 2008 R2 with the following: <br/>• The hotfix described in [KB982018](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=3052&kbid=982018). <br/>• Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 and Exchange Server 2010 SP1. <br/> Exchange 2013 and later supports native 4-kilobyte (KB) sector disks and 512e disks when all copies of a database reside on the same physical disk type. For example, it is not a supported configuration to host one copy of a given database on a 512-byte sector disk and another copy of that same database on a 512e disk or 4K disk. <br/> Best practice: Physical disk-write caching must be disabled when used without a UPS. <br/> In general, Exchange 2016 Mailbox servers don't require the performance characteristics of SSD storage.|

### Factors to consider when choosing disk types

There are several trade-offs when choosing disk types for Exchange 2016 storage. The correct disk is one that balances performance (both sequential and random) with capacity, reliability, power utilization, and capital cost. The following table of supported physical disk types provides information to help you when considering these factors.

From a performance perspective, using large, slower disks for Exchange storage is okay provided the disks can maintain average read and write latencies of 20ms or less under load.

**Factors in disk type choice**

## Best practices for supported storage configurations
<a name="Best"> </a>

This section provides best practice information about supported disk and array controller configurations. In addition to the commonly used Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID), there is also just a bunch of disks (or drives), or JBOD, which refers to a collection of hard disks that have not been configured to act as a redundant array.

RAID is often used to both improve the performance characteristics of individual disks (by striping data across several disks) as well as to provide protection from individual disk failures. With the advancements in Exchange 2016 high availability, RAID is not a required component for Exchange 2016 storage design. However, RAID is still an essential component of Exchange 2016 storage design for standalone servers as well as solutions that require storage fault tolerance.

 **Operating System, System, or Pagefile Volume**

The recommended configuration for an operating system, system, or pagefile volume is to utilize RAID technology to protect this data type. The recommended RAID configuration is either RAID-1 or RAID-1/0, however all RAID types are supported.

 **Separated Mailbox Database and Log Volumes**

If you're deploying a standalone Mailbox server role architecture, RAID technology is required for the mailbox database and log volumes. The recommended RAID configuration for mailbox volumes is RAID-1/0 (especially if you're using 5.4K or 7.2K disks); however all RAID types are supported. For log volumes, RAID-1 or RAID-1/0 is the recommended RAID configuration.

When using RAID-5 or RAID-6 configurations for the operating system, pagefile, or Exchange data volumes, note the following:

- RAID-5 configurations, including variations such as RAID-50 and RAID-51, should have no more than 7 disks per array group and array controller high-priority scrubbing and surface scanning enabled.

- RAID-6 configurations should have array controller high-priority scrubbing and surface scanning enabled.

Although JBOD is supported in high availability architectures that have 3 or more highly available database copies, because the log and mailbox database volumes are separated, JBOD is not recommended as a solution.

 **Mailbox Database and Log Volume Co-Location**

Mailbox database and log volume co-location is not recommended in standalone architectures. In high availability architectures, there are two possibilities for this scenario:

1. Single database per volume

2. Multiple databases per volume

 **Single Database Per Volume**

In an Exchange environment, a JBOD storage solution involves having both the database and its associated logs stored on a single disk. To deploy a JBOD solution, you must deploy a minimum of three highly available database copies. Utilizing a single disk is a single point of failure, because when the disk fails, the database copy residing on that disk is lost. Having a minimum of three database copies ensures fault tolerance by having two additional copies in the event that one copy (or one disk) fails. However, placement of three highly available database copies, as well as the use of lagged database copies, can affect storage design. The following table shows guidelines for RAID or JBOD considerations.

**RAID or JBOD Considerations**

|**Datacenter servers**|**Two highly available copies (total)**|**Three highly available copies (total)**|**Two or more highly available copies per datacenter**|**One lagged copy**|**Two or more lagged copies per datacenter**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Primary datacenter servers|RAID|RAID or JBOD (2 copies)|RAID or JBOD|RAID|RAID or JBOD|
|Secondary datacenter servers|RAID|RAID (1 copy)|RAID or JBOD|RAID|RAID or JBOD|

To deploy on JBOD with the primary datacenter servers, you need three or more highly available database copies within the DAG. If mixing lagged copies on the same server hosting highly available database copies (for example, not using dedicated lagged database copy servers), you need at least two lagged database copies.

For the secondary datacenter servers to use JBOD, you should have at least two highly available database copies in the secondary datacenter. The loss of a copy in the secondary datacenter won't result in requiring a reseed across the WAN or having a single point of failure in the event the secondary datacenter is activated. If mixing lagged database copies on the same server hosting highly available database copies (for example, not using dedicated lagged database copy servers), you need at least two lagged database copies.

For dedicated lagged database copy servers, you should have at least two lagged database copies within a datacenter to use JBOD. Otherwise the loss of disk results in the loss of the lagged database copy, as well as the loss of the protection mechanism.

 **Multiple Databases Per Volume**

Multiple databases per volume is a new JBOD scenario available in Exchange 2016 that allows for active and passive copies (including lagged copies) to be mixed on a single disk thus enabling better disk utilization. However, to deploy lagged copies in this manner, automatic lagged copy log file play down must be enabled. The following table shows guidelines for JBOD considerations for multiple databases per volume.

**JBOD Considerations**

|**Datacenter Servers**|**3 or more copies (total)**|**Two or more copies per datacenter**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Primary datacenter servers|JBOD|JBOD|
|Secondary datacenter servers|N/A|JBOD|

The following table provides guidance about storage array configurations for Exchange 2016.

**Supported RAID types for the Exchange 2016 Mailbox server role**

|**RAID type**|**Description**|**Supported or best practice**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Disk array RAID stripe size (KB)|The stripe size is the per disk unit of data distribution within a RAID set. Stripe size is also referred to as *block size*.|Best practice: 256 KB or greater. Follow storage vendor best practices.|
|Storage array cache settings|The cache settings are provided by a battery-backed caching array controller.|Best practice: 100 percent write cache (battery or flash backed cache) for DAS storage controllers in either a RAID or JBOD configuration. 75 percent write cache and 25 percent read cache (battery or flash backed cache) for other types of storage solutions such as SAN. If your SAN vendor has different best practices for cache configuration on their platform, follow the guidance of your SAN vendor.|
|Physical disk write caching|The settings for the cache are on each individual disk.|Supported: Physical disk write caching must be disabled when used without a UPS.|

The following table provides guidance about database and log file choices.

**Database and log file choices for the Exchange 2016 Mailbox server role**

|**Database and log file options**|**Description**|**Stand-alone: supported or best practice**|**High availability: supported or best practice**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
